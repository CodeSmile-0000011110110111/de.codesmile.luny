# Luny
Lua in Unity for everything!

For more info visit: https://lunyscript.com

This is an EARLY version of Luny. I am rewriting it from scratch to best support runtime, modding and editor scripting. It may not provide much functionality in its early versions.


## Requirements

Unity 6.0 or newer

It *might* work with 2022.3 or earlier but I'm not testing that. [Support for 2022.3 LTS has ended in May 2025](https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-2022-lts-end-of-life/1642861/2).
