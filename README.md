# Luny
Lua in Unity for everything!

For more info visit: https://lunyscript.com

This is an EARLY version of Luny. I am rewriting it from scratch to best support runtime, modding and editor scripting. It may not provide much functionality in its early versions.


## Requirements

Unity 6.0 or newer

It *might* work with 2022.3 or earlier but I'm not testing that. [Support for 2022.3 LTS has ended in May 2025](https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-2022-lts-end-of-life/1642861/2). 


## Installation

### Installer

For your convenience, I created an Installer package:

- Open Package Manager in Unity Editor
- Choose "Install package from git URL..."
- Enter this URL: `https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.luny-install`

This will add the necessary packages to Package Manager one by one.

### Manual Installation

If you'd rather do it yourself, follow these steps:

1. Open Package Manager in Unity Editor
2. Choose "Install package from git URL..."
3. Enter this URL: `https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.luacsharp`
4. Choose "Install package from git URL..."
5. Enter this URL: `https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.core`
6. Choose "Install package from git URL..."
7. Enter this URL: `https://github.com/CodeSmile-0000011110110111/de.codesmile.luny`
